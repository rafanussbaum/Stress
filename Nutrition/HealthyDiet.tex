With malnutrition over a longer time, we run the risk of getting sick, in any form, physical or psychologically.
The risk of a nutrition caused disease can be significantly reduced through a  healthy and adequate diet,
and by doing so we provide the requirements for the daily high usage to body and psyche.

\subsection{What is a Healthy Diet?}

The basis of a healthy nutrition is a supply of energy and nutrients in the sense of a full--fledged diet,
based on the needs and the load of the individual.
Under full-fledged we mean a quantitatively and qualitatively balanced selection of diverse foods,
which are beneficial to our health and supplies our organism with all vital nutrients.
A full--fledged diet also considers technological, ecological and social aspects.
It differs from the regular mixed diet by consciously choosing foods which:
\begin{itemize}
\item are regional
\item seasonally available
\item which do without additives
\item are produced ecologically and/or livestock--friendly (organic products)
\item which are processed, packed and transport in an environment friendly manner
  \item warrant a fair price/income (ie. coffee from Max Havelar)
  \end{itemize}

  That means in short: Food as close to it's natural state as possible, seasonal and from the region
  prepared in a gentle manner and in the amount, which correspond to the amounts given by the food pyramid (MyPlate).

Many factors influence our eating and drinking behaviour: individual needs and cravings, the daily mood and feeling, the social surrounding,
the current offer of food, advertisment, \ldots The following recommendations are meant for healthy adults.
Other prts of the population (ie. children, pregnant women, athletes, vegetarians, \ldots) have special food needs,
which can only the be partially represented with the same pyramid.

  \textbf{Behavior to stay or become slender}
  A balanced, diversified diet, according to seasonal availability and low in meat and with many fresh products helps to guide the choices.

  \textbf{Favorable:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Varied mixed diet
  \item A lot fo fresh fruit and vegetables
  \item Drink a lot (preferably water)
    \item 
  \end{itemize}
