With malnutrition over a longer time, we run the risk of getting sick, in any form, physical or psychologically.
The risk of a nutrition caused disease can be significantly reduced through a  healthy and adequate diet,
and by doing so we provide the requirements for the daily high usage to body and psyche.

\section{What is a Healthy Diet?}

The basis of a healthy nutrition is a supply of energy and nutrients in the sense of a full--fledged diet,
based on the needs and the load of the individual.
Under full-fledged we mean a quantitatively and qualitatively balanced selection of diverse foods,
which are beneficial to our health and supplies our organism with all vital nutrients.
A full--fledged diet also considers technological, ecological and social aspects.
It differs from the regular mixed diet by consciously choosing foods which:
\begin{itemize}
\item are regional
\item seasonally available
\item which do without additives
\item are produced ecologically and/or livestock--friendly (organic products)
\item which are processed, packed and transport in an environment friendly manner
  \item warrant a fair price/income (ie. coffee from Max Havelar)
  \end{itemize}

  That means in short: Food as close to it's natural state as possible, seasonal and from the region
  prepared in a gentle manner and in the amount, which correspond to the amounts given by the food pyramid (MyPlate).

Many factors influence our eating and drinking behavior: individual needs and cravings, the daily mood and feeling, the social surrounding,
the current offer of food, advertisement, \ldots The following recommendations are meant for healthy adults.
Other parts of the population (ie. children, pregnant women, athletes, vegetarians, \ldots) have special food needs,
which can only the be partially represented with the same pyramid.


The food pyramid represents a healthy mixed diet, which supplies an adequate amount of energy, plus the vital nutrients and elements needed
and contributes significantly to our well--being.
Foods in the lower levels of the pyramid should be eaten in bigger quantities, whereas the higher levels only in smaller quantities.
All foods are allowed.
It's important that it's as varied as possible and preferably according to the season's harvest.
The food should be prepared in a mild manner and in quantities according to the food pyramid.

% This is the new one. there's a mediterean one, a vegan one and so on, depending on needs, USA is now myplate

A healthy diet also should be a pleasure and a treat; that works best in company.
These recommendations aren't meant to be followed on a daily base, but more on a longer term base, for instance over the course of a week.
An exception to that is the liquid intake, which should be followed on a daily base.

Our health doesn't only dependent on our diet.
To maintain a healthy body weight it is imperative to move daily at least half an hour (possibly outdoors).
Abstain for smoking and other recreational drugs and the right behavior with stress situations
(ie. conscious and targeted relaxation) are also part of a healthy life style

\noindent Additionally, 3 portions milk or milk products per day, preferably versions reduced in fats
(1 portion = \SI{2}{\deci\liter} (\sfrac{7}{8} cup), 150 -- \SI{180}{\gram} (5\sfrac{1}{4} -- 6\sfrac{3}{8} oz.) yogurt
or \SI{200}{\gram} (7 oz.) curd cheese or cottage cheese or 30--\SI{60}{\gram} (1--2\sfrac{1}{8} oz.) cheese).

\subsubsection{5$^{th}$ level --- oils, fats and nuts: daily in moderation}

2--3 tea spoons (10--\SI{15}{\gram}, \sfrac{3}{8} -- \sfrac{1}{2} oz.) high--grade plant oil like canola or olive oil for the cold food (ie. salad dressing).
