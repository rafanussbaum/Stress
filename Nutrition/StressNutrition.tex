Having to constantly endure stress, fears and sorrows makes you gain weight.
Moments of shock, physical or emotional overtaxed and injuries of any kind automatically trigger our survival program\index{survival program}.
This innate survival program is as old as living being themselves, and it doesn't matter if an aggressive bear or an overdue tax declaration
is threatening us.
No matter if real hunger drives us out to forage and hunt nights after nights or if it's mobbing or the overdrawn bank account.
It can be a real enemy with real weapons threatening us and our family or the the fear of a test which freezes us up.
We can get hurt in a real combat of by words or gestures.
No matter if others despise and disapprove of you, or if it is you yourself who despises and disapproves of you.
Our organism always reacts with the same program: our survival mode.
Our  organism wants to either fight, act, hide or flee.
