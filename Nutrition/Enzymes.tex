Enzymes\index{enzyme} are of vital importance for the organism and its metabolism.
Enzymes act as bio-catalysts and direct almost all biochemical reactions in the organism, by accelerating, slowing down or even just allowing them to happen.
Enzymes are like the ``spark plugs'' of the metabolism.

Some enzymes need a coenzyme\index{coenzyme} (often a vitamin) or a cofactor\index{cofactor}
(mineral or trace element) to be able to execute their catalytic functions.
In some enzymes, they are directly participating in the catalytic process,
in others they only serve as a temporary carrier of a specific functional group.
The concentration of coenzymes and cofactors in the cells is very small.
Nevertheless they are essential for the catalytic action of the enzymes and they play a very important role in the metabolism of the cell.

The activity of the enzyme is dependent on enzyme concentration, temperature and pH-- value of the surroundings.
Some enzymes need and alkaline surrounding to work, others an acidic one.

Enzymes are by definition protein molecules, which appear in a overwhelming amount in the human body.
It is estimated that about 75,000 different types of enzymes are working in and for the human body,
but maybe a few dozen of them which have been researched in depth so far.
Each of these protein molecules works in the human body in a specific way, like for instance during digestion,
building up of proteins or to furnish the cell with energy.
The activity of enzymes isn't limited to the metabolism.
They also pay an important role in the perception and transmission of impulses inside of the cells, in the immune system or
in the process of remove toxins from he body.
Without enzymes, the miracle of life that the human body is wouldn't work at all.

Enzymes are produced in the human or plant.
That means, there are enzymes, which are produced in the human body, others are supplied with the food, for instance with fruits and veggies.
Enzymes are sensitive to heat and cold.
The enzymatic activity of foods strongly decreases above 49\degree C (120\degree F) or below the freezing point.

Given that neither vitamins, minerals nor hormones can do their job without the corresponding enzymes, the lack of enzymes or the
presence of defect enzymes can have serious health related consequences.
Some enzyme defects are genetically inherited.
For instance the gene defect, which has an influence in the coding of the enzyme responsible for the intake of zinc and
leads to the symptom of not being able to take in a sufficient amount of zinc from the food.
