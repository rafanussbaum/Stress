Vitamins\index{vitamin} are vital oragnic compunds, which the human body needs for vital body functions.
Vitamins can't be synthsized by the human body, or only in insufccient amounts or only certain external conditions,
like for instance that sun light is present.
Vitamins have to be supplemented, as vitamins themselves or as their prucursours, previtamins.
Out of these provitamins, the body can then build the active form, the vitamins.
PPretty much every food pretty much has their own set of vitamines contained and contibutes to the daily needs being covered.
