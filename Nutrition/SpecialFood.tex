\section{Coffee}

A cup of coffee\index{food!coofee} needs \SI{24}{hours}, to pass through the kindeys and the urine tract.
When you drink multiple cupsof coffee a day, then this will put a load on the internal organs.
Decoffeinated coffee is better in that respect, but it still forms acids in our body.

When you drink a coffee with your food, you force the food faster out of your digestive system
and it decrese the mobility of the colon. Undigested food is the main reason for constipation\index{symtpom!constipation} or on the other side a reason for the too fast processing, diarrhea\index{symptom!diarrhea}.
Coffee and black tea are strongly acid forming.
The more acid in the blood, the more water the body remains to neutralize or dilute the acid.
Thais is a burden for the body and means a gain in weight.
Try to drink herbal teas instead.

Additionally, caffeine is a stimulant for the central nervous system --- similar to cocaine.
It is associated with a series of conditions, like hightnened heart activity\index{symptom!heart activity, heightened},
changes in the vessel diameter\index{symptom!blood vessel, diameter change},
irregular blood flow in the coronary veesels\index{symptom!coronary vessels!irregular blood flow},
heightened blood pressure\index{symptom!blood pressure!heightened},
diabetes\index{symptom!diabetes},
kindey failure\index{symptom!kidney failure},
ulsters in the stomach\index{symptom!ulsters, stomach},
pancreas problems\index{symptom!pancreas problems},
noises in your ears\index{symptom!noises in your ears},
amyostasia\index{symptom!amyostasia},
feeling restless\index{symptom!restlessness},
sleeping problems\index{symptom!sleeping problems} and
digestive problems\index{symptom!digestion, problems}.
On top of that it messes up the blood sugar level by forcing the pancreas to secrete insulin.
