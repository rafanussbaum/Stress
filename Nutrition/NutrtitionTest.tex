Nutrition test of the Swiss Society of Nutrition~\cite{SGE}. Analyze your nutritional habits.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{By filling out this questionnaire below, you easily find out in which areas your nutritional habits leaves room for improvement
  and therefore a change is especially important.}

\vspace{5mm}

Maybe you think now: ``But I already know that for a long time!''
Let yourself be surprised, maybe is what you perceived as a big weakness in your nutrition as not even that problematic!

On the other side you might have some ``blind spots in your perception'' (like most people),
nutritional habits which are ingrained and ``guilty pleasures'' which you might not even have considered before.
That might mean, that a change doesn't even have to start, where you always thought it would have to.
