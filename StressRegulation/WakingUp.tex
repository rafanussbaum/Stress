Make a commitment to yourself, to get up earlier in the morning than usual.
Already this action alone, will change your life.
Make this time, however long as it might be, to a time to be, to a time which you dedicate to being consciously awake.
Don't fill this time up, except with pure awareness.
There's no need to go over your tasks and chores ahead of you during the day, and in that way preemptively get a head start on the future act of being.
This is a time of no--time, of silence, for being present; a time which you spend all alone with yourself.

In the moment of waking up, even before you get up, get in touch with your breath and feel the different sensations in your body.
Pay attention if there are some thoughts or feelings, and let this attention touch the current moment.
Do you feel the breath?
Are you capable to perceive the start of each inhale?
Are you able to enjoy the feeling, that the breath freely enters your body in this very moment?
Ask yourself: ``Am I truly awake now?''}
