The Sun Salutation\index{sun salutation} (sanskrit: Surya Namaskar) increases your physical strength, flexibility, your inner balance and your mental clarity.
Practiced first thing in the morning, it gets you instantaneously awake and active.
Practiced in the evening, it helps free up blocked energies.

The sun salutation is classical exercise from yoga, which consist in a fluid motion which goes through multiple positions.
The Sun Salutation stimulates all internal organs, stretches and twists the spinal cord, all the limbs and all muscle groups.
If you practice it on a regular base you will notice how it gives you strength and how you will get flooded with energy.

\begin{itemize}
\item Your breath determines the speed.
  Upon inhalation, the spine gets stretched backwards, on exhale it gets stretched forward.
  Breather calmly while executing this exercise, but consciously.
\item Make sure that you practice it in fresh air.
  Make sure that your body can move freely (no tight clothes, bare foot).
  The sun salutation is best practices before meals, otherwise your energy and your blood are going to be occupied with digestion.
\item Execute all exercises calmly and without pressure. If you are not flexible enough yet for a posture, then go as far as you are able to go, without forcing it.
  It's important that the movements are executed fluidly and consciously --- in your mind intended as a salutation to the sun.
\item In the beginning, you will probably be unable to bring your head down to your knees, or touching the ground with your palms while bending forwards.
  Keep your patience and your sense of fun. In the beginning it's enough if the tip of your fingers touch the ground.
  Your body has to first get used to the movements and with these exercises it will get more flexible and will get to move smoothly.
\end{itemize}

There are many different types of the sun salutation out there.
There is no one correct passed down tradition of yoga, but only old scripts of poses were discovered and their interpretation gave rise to the modern practice of yoga.
The sequence of the sun salutation shown in the picture above is a common version of the sun salutation, practiced in many different yoga traditions.
The sequence that I am teaching here is a version which is less straining and well suited for people of advanced age or with physical impairments, as it is easier on the body\cite{VidyaYoga}.
For me it's more important that the practice is sustainable and fun, then possible ``the correct version'' but more strenuous, and more likely to demotivate people.
Fun with the activity is an important part of practice and makes it way more likely a practice that I can sustain over time.
If you learned a different sequence of sun salutation in your yoga class, by all means  practice the one you are familiar with.

If you want to repeat the sequence, just continue straight into the bending forward pose.
Take this time for the warrior pose (one leg backwards) first the right leg.
After the dog pose, take this time also the right leg forward.

\subsubsection{Termination}

\begin{itemize}
\item Upon exhale, lead your hands in front of your sternum.
\item Focus your attention on the region of your heart.
\item Now lower your arms.
\item Stay a moment in this pose and feel the effects on your body.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{If you want to make Multiple Repetitions}

Stop the sun salutation after the cycle in which you put first your right leg backwards with these two poses.
After that start all over again for two more repetitions, once with your left leg going backwards, then the second one with your right leg going backwards.

To be clear on that point: you could think that after the described twelve poses one repetition is terminated.
In my understanding a repetition is only terminated, when once my left foot goes backwards first and then my right foot the second time round.
For me, that means being balanced.
