\epigraph{The future has many names. For the weak one it is the unattainable. For the fearsome one it is the unknown. For the brave one it is the chance.}{\textit{Victor Hugo}}

\subsubsection{Salutogenesis}
\index{salutogenesis}
One solution consists in switching from problem--oriented thinking (pathogenesis) to {solution--oriented thinking} (salutogenesis). In order to do so, check the task at hand.
Is it a {real} task or a very {urgent task}? Could it be a {self--imposed task}, which can be reduced by your own means?

Life meanders over heights and through lows and leads to yourself. If you want to master that journey well, has to rest and strengthen yourself. Movement and equilibrium exercises are a very useful tool to achieve this goal. The physical equilibrium is the base for the mental equilibrium.
In other words: we have to daily invest into us doing well and that we will be doing well in the future.

Instead of fighting the disease you {improve health}. Health isn't only the absence of disease but the \emph{presence of life quality}.
