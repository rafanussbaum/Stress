In this context, two different types of strain are relevant for stress regulation.

\begin{description}
\item[Stimulus Strain]\index{strain!stimulus} is when an always recurring event makes me angry. ``My partner \textbf{always} leaves the toothbrush in the sink". 
\item[Exterior Strain:] Everybody wants to {influence and control others}. There are many examples of it in inter--human relationships. 
There's as well the self inflicted heteronomy in the visual and auditory areas (media, commercials, Animals, \ldots). 

TV influences our society and sometimes educates the kids.
