        \epigraph{When we start to the look at the sense of balance that means it's about a multi layered balancing of the body and not only to keep the equilibrium with parts of our body.
          If the posture harmonises with the big energy systems, the human being feels free: it feels that everything is in flow, inside themselves, around them and into it.
          Everything inside is connected to the outside, a harmony between the being and the universe arises.}{\textit{Joan Skinner}}
