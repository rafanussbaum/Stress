    \textbf{Drink Water:} 
    Water is an excellent {conductor} for electrical energy.
    An optimal learning performance requires our {hydration levels} to be {balanced}.
    The water balances allows the {efficient storage and retrieval of information} in the brain and in the body
    and activates {optimal electrical and chemical processes} between the brain and the nervous system.\\

    \textbf{Brain Buttons:}
Hold one {hand over the belly button} or massage a big area,  the other hand massages the {points underneath the collarbone}, immediately left and right of the sternum on the first rib.
According to acupuncture, these are the end points of the kidney meridian\footnote{energy pathway in our body)}.

{{Same side 10 times}} (right elbow to right knee alternated with other side, 5 times each) {eyes in the lower right corner}.
{{Alternating:}} 1 time cross over, each direction once, eyes left up. 1 time same side, each side once, eyes down right. Repeat this 4 times, gives 16 movements.
 
{{Possible progression:}} Add 16 times cross over with eyes closed.
