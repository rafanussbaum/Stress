The word  proprioception (proprius = ``own'', ``itself'') means as much as ``{perception} or reception of the {body's own stimuli}''.
To perceive these stimuli, we need corresponding {peripheral receptors}.
Those are present in the posture and movement system of the body in joint capsules, muscles, tendons, fascia and in the skin.
They are called {mechano--receptors} and exist in different forms. 
As the receptors of the equilibrium system, they transmit information about the {position and movement of the body} to the central nervous system, over sensitive afferent (incoming) nerves.
The central nervous system {reacts} to these afferent stimuli with efferent (outgoing to the periphery) impulses.
