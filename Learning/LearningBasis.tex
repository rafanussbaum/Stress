We are going to look at a few real and imaginary accelerators and inhibitors to learning, training and broadening our skills in more or less acute stress situations. They are going to be further elaborated on in the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item The biological and physiological basis of learning
\item Learning and it's effects
\item The definition of problem
\item Training and practicing
\item Tap into other areas of your brain
\item The meta--cognitive exercises, their mechanics and how they act on the brain.
  \item In the context above, explore possibilities to regulate stress with different psycho--motor capacities.
\end{itemize}
