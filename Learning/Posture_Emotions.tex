  \noindent If we stand easily and in balance we use exactly the minimum amount of energy,
  which is necessary to counteract earth's gravity and which allow us to perceive our whole organism in it's totality.
  We can choose to renounce on the usage of our eyes to orient and just focus on feeling.

  Eventually we are going to register, that the slightest changes in the distribution of the body's mass
  produces different perceptions of strain, or relief in the muscles and while breathing.
  When we get closer to the state of equilibrium, there's a feeling of lightness, freedom, of happiness and of peace, which isn't comparable to any other experience.
  We discover, that we're eternally in flow, nothing is static.
