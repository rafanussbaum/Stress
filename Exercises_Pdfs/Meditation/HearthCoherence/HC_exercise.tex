Research showed in a study, that already the \structure{memory of pleasant feelings} is enough to trigger a chaotic heart beat to \structure{become coherent}.

Coherence has an effect on the \structure{performance of the brain}, too. The coherence shows as an \structure{equilibrium between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system}. In that state we can access the \structure{wisdom} of the emotional brain and the \structure{planning} of the cognitive brain.

Coherence acts on 3 levels against stress: \structure{physically, emotionally and socially}. Coherence leads to an \structure{inner peace and calm}, which can be applied to \structure{everyday} situations and over time can be \structure{automatised}. 

(That means, heart coherence is not a meditation but an \structure{exercise to reach coherence again} in every day's life.)

Positive effects: Means to control \structure{fear and depression}, lowering of the \structure{blood pressure}, fortifying the \structure{heart}, 
increasing the capacity of the \structure{immune system}, promote the own \structure{feelings}, promote \structure{heart consciousness} and \structure{removal of armour} which has been put on as self--protection.
