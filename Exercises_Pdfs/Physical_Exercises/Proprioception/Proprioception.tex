\hypertarget{proprioception}{}
The word  proprioception (proprius = ``own'', ``itself'') means as much as ``\structure{perception} or reception of the \structure{body's own stimuli}''.

To perceive these stimuli, we need corresponding \structure{peripheral receptors}. Those are present in the posture and movement system of the body in joint capsules, muscles, tendons, fascia and in the skin. They are called \structure{mechano--receptors} and exist in different forms. 

As the receptors of the equilibrium system, they transmit information about the \structure{position and movement of the body} to the central nervous system, over afferent (incoming) nerves. The central nervous system \structure{reacts} to these afferent stimuli with efferent (outgoing to the periphery) impulses.
