\frametitle{Position}
Whenever there's a grey mist on your soul,
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] \structure{anchor} both of your \structure{legs} solidly on the ground, 
\item[-] let your \structure{shoulders drop}, from their pulled up position,
\item[-] \structure{erect the head} and spine, 
\item[-] pull the the corners of your mouth up (\structure{smile})
\item[-] and \structure{breathe} into your \structure{lower belly}, at least \structure{three times}. \\
(If that's not possible, then press on your belly while exhaling, your next breath will for sure go in the lower belly)
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Exhale sorrows --- inhale strength}
While you continue the deep and relaxed breathing, imagine that you \structure{exhale the fears, tensions, sorrows, and doubts} out of your body, they stream out through your nose and mouth.

During the inhales, \structure{inhale fresh and clear energy, strength, courage and confidence} deep into your whole body. Feel how this freshness and vitality \structure{spreads further with every inhale} -- into the tips of your finger, the toes, the whole surface of your skin and the tips of your hair.

\frametitle{Radiate like the sun}
Continue to inhale calmness and clarity and exhale sorrows until you feel so light and bright, that \structure{your inner light radiates like the sun} to the outside through every pore of your body. An inch far, a foot, a yard, many yards far.

You can breathe at \structure{any time and everywhere} in a way that you become the sun. Sitting on the desk, in the car, on the phone, while watching TV, during a conversation, while falling asleep and while waking up.
