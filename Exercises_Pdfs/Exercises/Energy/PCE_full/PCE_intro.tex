  \frametitle{The Rune Exercises}

  The first six exercises are called the \structure{rune exercises}.
  They are modeled after the \structure{rune rites} of the Germanic tribes of old.
  Already the Edda talked about rune wisdom, which can be achieved either by the spoken words or certain finger or body postures.


  For simplicity's sake we name the rune exercises by their Latin letters.
  They bring the natural \structure{life energy}, the energy which as always present in our bodies, into an unobstructed \structure{flow}.
  They also help to \structure{deconstruct muscular tension} and \structure{activate the function of you glands}.
  They also help you to achieve \structure{harmony and equilibrium}.
  The life energy which is constantly flowing gets channeled and activated.
  These exercises are also suited for elderly people, they can't trigger any unwanted side effects.
