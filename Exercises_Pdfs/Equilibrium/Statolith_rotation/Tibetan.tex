The \structure{arms} are \structure{extended sidewards}, the elbows are slightly flexed, the hands almost shoulder height, the fingers slightly spread. 

\structure{Focus a point} with your eyes. Make little steps and \structure{turn your body} on the spot to the right, the \structure{head stays in place}. 

As soon as you can't hold the point                                                                                       anymore with your head, \structure{swivel your head swiftly} around and focus on a point in the opposite direction. The feet and the body continue to turn.

After a while you can \structure{turn faster}, lift your heels off the floor.

Sit on the floor and put your feet on the ground, the hands are besides your hip.

\structure{Lift your hip} and lead it to the front and up.

\structure{Inhale} while letting your \structure{head roll back} (it's not an own movement, the head just rolls due to the movement of the hip).

Now lead your \structure{hip down and back} and let the \structure{head roll deeply forward}, while exhaling (keep the muscles in the neck relaxed).

Swing with your body forth and back and let your head roll with the movement. After a while you can increase the speed of the swinging.
