Already the breath only can optimize situations of tension which occured.
Do you belong to the very relaxed and balanced people who could profit from more tension\index{effect!tension!regulate}
or more to the active up to overactive, which can't let go of their tension.
Choose your exercise!

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Build up tension,} for instance in the case or tiredness:

  Close the left nostril and inhale through your right one.
  To exhale you close the right nostril and exhale through the left one.

\item \emph{Lower tension:}

  Close the right nostril and inhale through the left one.
  To exhale you close the left nostril and exhale through the right one.

\item \emph{Balance tension:}

  Close the left nostril and inhale through your right one.
  To exhale you close the right nostril and exhale through the left one.

  Then you change:
   Close the right nostril and inhale through the left one.
  To exhale you close the left nostril and exhale through the right one.

\end{enumerate}
