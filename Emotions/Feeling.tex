Neurology describes a feeling as the subjective experiencing of excitation and brain--chemical activity.
Love, hate, envy, jealousy, disgust, antipathy, fear, anxiety, sadnes, feeling of security, hope are clear designiation for the state of a feeling.
Feeling can trigger, reinforce or inhibit actions and increase or numb perception.
