\section{Variations}

All the six steps of DMT are important.
With the statement in the third step you alone decide in which direction you go and which expectations you want to fulfill.
A precise way of stating the goal, a truly precise way of expressing the symptom make DMT a very efficient instrument.
Let's have a look at a few examples of it in action.\\

\noindent \emph{Emotional statements:}\\
``I have pain in the third joint of my left little finger\ldots''\\
``I feel fear/tightness in my chest\ldots''\\
``I fell anger in my belly\ldots''\\
``I have the feeling to needing to eat, when I'm sitting in front of the TV\ldots''\\

\noindent \emph{Cognitive statements}, from the past or in the future:\\
``When I think about what happened\ldots''\\
``When I think about the fact that I  will have to give that speech\ldots``\\

\noindent \emph{Strengthening statements:}\\
``I have the strength to speak in front of people, without getting nervous. Yes, I can do that. Make this happen.''\\
``My body knows how to get rid of superfluous pounds. Yes, he knows it. He immediately starts doing that.''

\section{Stress Regulation}

Making DMT to repeating thing, a regular ritual with the same statement (typically in the morning or evening),
you will be able to also dissolve deeper lying states of tension.
The term ``The Dynamind--Comfort--Minute'' got coined for that activity.

Suggestions for statements to use for the Dynamind--Comfort--Minute:

``In my body or my spirit, there could be fears, a feelings of oppression, sorrows or doubts. That can change. I want all these problems to disappear.''

``In my body or my spirit, there could be anger, a rejection or guilt. That can change. I want all these problems to disappear.''

``In my body or my spirit, there's somewhere love, peace, harmony and joy. That is good the way it is. I want these feelings to get stronger and spread.''

``In my body or my spirit, there's somewhere force and strength, health and liveliness. That is good the way it is. I want these feelings to get stronger and spread.''

You absolutely can change up these sentences according to your needs and intentions.

\section{Possibilities}

DMT has been used thousands of times successfully, with physical pains\index{symptom!pain}, sickness\index{symptom!sickness}, in states of fatigue\index{symptom!fatigue},
insomnia\index{symptom!insomnia}, feelings of fear\index{symptom!fear}, anger\index{symptom!anger} and guilt\index{symptom!guilt}, depression\index{symptom!depression} and
with stress\index{symptom!stress}. The list is a long one.

It can happen, that pain or a symptom changes or changes the location after a round of DMT.
One layer has been uncovered and underlying pain now comes, which in turn waits be released.
In the course of a human life, many layers can build up.
If we don't pay attention to them, we will carry them around our whole lives.

If f third round of DMT isn't dissolving a physical symptom, you can assume that a suppressed emotion is part of it --- regardless if you are aware of such an emotion or not.
Most often it is fear or anger.
Try in a moment like this something like ``I feel fear in my shoulders\ldots'' or ``My eyes are being afraid of something\ldots''.

Mental resistance also can dampen an effect or even make it impossible. In situations like these, you know other techniques which might be suited for a case like this.
