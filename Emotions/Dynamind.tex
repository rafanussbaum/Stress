All the six steps of DMT are important.
With the statement in the third step you alone decide in which direction you go and which expectations you want to fulfill.
A precise way of stating the goal, a truly precise way of expressing the symptom make DMT a very efficient instrument.
Let's have a look at a few examples of it in action.\\

\noindent \emph{Emotional statements:}\\
``I have pain in the third joint of my left little finger\ldots''\\
``I feel fear/tightness in my chest\ldots''\\
``I fell anger in my belly\ldots''\\
``I have the feeling to needing to eat, when I'm sitting in front of the TV\ldots''\\

\noindent \emph{Cognitive statements}, from the past or in the future:\\
``When I think about what happened\ldots''\\
``When I think about the fact that I  will have to give that speech\ldots``\\

\noindent \emph{Strengthening statements:}\\
``I have the strength to speak in front of people, without getting nervous. Yes, I can do that. Make this happen.''\\
``My body knows how to get rid of superfluous pounds. Yes, he knows it. He immediately starts doing that.''
